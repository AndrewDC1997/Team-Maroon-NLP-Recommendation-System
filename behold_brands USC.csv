01EWZVGFGZB5RN8HBR6YH14SNP,M.M.LaFleur,Women Owned,"Founder and CEO Sarah LaFleur got her start as a management consultant. Frustrated by a lack of women’s workwear options that were both stylish and practical, she teamed up with Miyako Nakamura (the former head designer of Zac Posen) and Narie Foster to launch M.M.LaFleur in 2013. Since then, they’ve grown into a team of go-getters who are committed to creating a better future for women. Miyako serves as their Creative Director, and her high-end design sensibility is a beautiful complement to Sarah’s focus on practicality.

When Miyako and her team create a piece of clothing, they make sure it encompasses three things: functional details (think: adjustable hems and bra-strap holders); comfort (and not just comfortable-for-a-blazer comfort—they strive for I-could-nap-in-this comfort); and style—so you can be the most chic, polished person in every room you enter. If you’re new to their brand, start by checking out their best-selling essentials.","This line fulfills my everyday needs, with pieces for work AND life.

Whether they’re offering complimentary clothing loans to female political candidates or fitting (and refitting, then refitting again) a new dress designed to move seamlessly between your office and elsewhere, they do it all with the goal of championing working women.","This blazer has a secret: its seams contain stretchy knit inserts, so you can stretch, bend, and snap with ease.",Live with purpose.

We use organic cotton and natural dyes alongside the worlds first plastic-free stretch denim, all washed sustainably using a combination of e-flow, ozone, and lasers to make authentic vintage looking denim without the harmful processes that to date have sadly been a staple in denim manufacturing. 

We then offset the remaining carbon footprint from each pair of jeans via a tailored carbon offset program that contributes a portion of each sale to three different global projects. This makes Triarchy a carbon neutral brand. 

Lastly, we provide total transparency on triarchy.com to our supply chain via a 3rd party audited and block chain verified supply chain map that is publicly available for interacting alongside the positive impact statements of each of our products sustainable manufacturing practices and their carbon offset project verifications.
